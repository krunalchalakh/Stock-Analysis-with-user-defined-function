Problem Statement>>
1. Create a new table named 'bajaj1' containing the date, close price, 20 Day MA and 50 Day MA. (This has to be done for all 6 stocks)

 

             Date            	            Close Price             	              20 Day MA           	             50 Day MA               
 

2. Create a master table containing the date and close price of all the six stocks. (Column header for the price is the name of the stock)

 

The table header should appear as below:

 

          Date         	      Bajaj        	       TCS      	   TVS      	     Infosys   	      Eicher       	        Hero         
 

3. Use the table created in Part(1) to generate buy and sell signal. Store this in another table named 'bajaj2'. Perform this operation 
for all stocks.

 

        Date      	          Close Price       	      Signal        
 

4. Create a User defined function, that takes the date as input and returns the signal for that particular day (Buy/Sell/Hold) for the 
Bajaj stock.
